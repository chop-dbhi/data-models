pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,labhistoryid,YES,,,,NO,,,,Arbitrary identifier for each unique LAB_HISTORY record.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,lab_loinc,YES,,,,NO,,,,"Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINCÂ®) from the Regenstrief Institute. Current LOINC codes are from 3-7 characters long but Regenstrief suggests a length of 10 for future growth. The last digit of the LOINC code is a check digit and is always preceded by a hyphen. All parts of the LOINC code, including the hyphen, must be included. Do not pad the LOINC code with leading zeros."
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,lab_facilityid,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Arbitrary local code that identifies the facility providing lab results.Used in instances where partners are aggregating laboratory results from a number of different organizations. LAB_FACILITYID can be a true identifier, or a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source data partner."
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,sex,NO,,,,NO,,,,Sex to which this unit and range applies.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,race,NO,,,,NO,,,,Race to which this unit and range applies.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,age_min_wks,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Minimum age to which this unit and range applies, in weeks."
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,age_max_wks,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Maximum age to which this unit and range applies, in weeks."
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,result_unit,NO,,,,NO,,,,Converted/standardized units for the specified LOINC.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,norm_range_low,NO,,,,NO,,,,Lower bound of the normal range assigned by the laboratory.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,norm_modifier_low,NO,,,,NO,,,,Modifier for NORM_RANGE_LOW values.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,norm_range_high,NO,,,,NO,,,,Upper bound of the normal range assigned by the laboratory.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,norm_modifier_high,NO,,,,NO,,,,Modifier for NORM_RANGE_HIGH values.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,period_start,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Initial date when the unit and range are known to be in use for the specified age range, race, sex and facility."
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,period_end,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Date when the unit and range are no longer in use for the specified age range, race, sex and facility."
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,raw_lab_name,NO,,,,NO,,,,Local name related to an individual lab test.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,raw_unit,NO,,,,NO,,,,Original units in your source data.
pcornet,v7.0,lab_history,raw_range,NO,,,,NO,,,,Original reference range in your source data.
