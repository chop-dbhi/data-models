pcornet,v5.1,obs_gen, "This table provides a generalized structure for storing observations and is not optimized for analytical efficiency. As elements from this table are used in studies and/or distributed queries, additional representations of those data elements (i.e., new table structures) may be required to better support those activities",
pcornet,v5.1,hash_token, "Encrypted hash tokens that are used to match patient records across DataMarts using privacy-preserving record linkage methods.",
pcornet,v5.1,immunization, "Records of immunizations that have been delivered within the health system as well as reports of those administered elsewhere.",
pcornet,v5.1,lds_address_history, "Longitudinal record of a patient’s address that adheres to the requirements of a Limited Data Set.",
pcornet,v5.1,private_demographic, "Protected table that is intended to provide a standardized representation of the personally-identifiable information (PII) that is needed to support local activities related to record linkage.",
pcornet,v5.1,private_address_history, "Protected table that can be used to store elements of a patient’s address that are considered personal health information (PHI). These data can be used for geocoding or other linkage projects.",
pcornet,v5.1,private_address_geocode, "Protected table that can be used to store the results of geocoding algorithms.",
