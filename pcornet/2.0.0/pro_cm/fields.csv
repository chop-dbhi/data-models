Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) from the Regenstrief Institute. Results with local versions of LOINC codes (e.g., LOINC candidate codes) should be included in the RAW_table field, but the PRO_LOINC variable should be set to missing. Current LOINC codes are from 3-7 characters long but Regenstrief suggests a length of 10 for future growth. The last digit of the LOINC code is a check digit and is always preceded by a hyphen. All parts of the LOINC code, including the hyphen, must be included. Do not pad the LOINC code with leading zeros.
