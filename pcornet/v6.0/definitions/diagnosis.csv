pcornet,v6.0,diagnosis,diagnosisid,YES,,,,,,,,"Arbitrary identifier for each unique record. Does not need to be persistent across refreshes, and may be created by methods such as sequence or GUID."
pcornet,v6.0,diagnosis,dx,YES,,,,NO,,,,"Diagnosis code. Leading zeroes and different levels of decimal precision are permissible in this field. Please populate the exact textual value of this diagnosis code, but remove source-specific suffixes and prefixes. Other codes should be listed as recorded in the source data. Some codes will contain leading zeroes, and different levels of decimal precision may also be present. This field is a character field, not numeric, to accommodate these coding conventions. (Description updated in v4.)"

We include these categories to allow some flexibility in implementation. The context is to capture available diagnoses recorded during a specific encounter. It is not necessary to populate interim diagnoses unless readily available.    Ambulatory encounters would generally be expected to have a source of “Final.”"

We provide values for ICD and SNOMED code types. Other code types will be added as new terminologies are more widely used.    Please note: The “Other” category is meant to identify internal use ontologies and codes."

Relevant only on IP and IS encounters. For ED, AV, and OA encounter types, mark as X=Unable to Classify. (Billing systems do not require a primary diagnosis for ambulatory visits (eg, professional services).) One principle diagnosis per encounter is expected, although in some instances more than one diagnosis may be flagged as principal."
