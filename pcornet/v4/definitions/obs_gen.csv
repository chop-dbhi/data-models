pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgenid,YES,,,,NO,,,,Arbitrary identifier for each unique OBS_GEN record. 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,patid,YES,DEMOGRAPHIC,PATID,,NO,,,,Arbitrary person-level identifier. Used to link across tables. 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,encounterid,NO,ENCOUNTER,ENCOUNTERID,,NO,,,,Arbitrary encounter-level identifier used to link across tables. This field should be populated if the observation was recorded as part of a healthcare encounter. 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_providerid,NO,PROVIDER,PROVIDERID,,NO,,,,Provider code for the provider who recorded the observation. The provider code is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the real identifier. 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_date,NO,,,YYYY-MM-DD,NO,DATE,,,Date of observation/measurement 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_time,NO,,,HH:MI (24-hour clock and zero padding),NO,TIME,,,Time of observation/measurement.

Networks/partners can define their own terminologies with strings starting with UD_. Strings that start with PC_ are reserved for network-wide activities and will be assigned by the Coordinating Center. 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_code,NO,,,,NO,,,,Standardized code denoting the observations based on the terminology/vocabulary specified in OBSGEN_TYPE 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_result_qual,NO,,,,NO,,,,Standardized result for qualitative results. This variable should be NI for quantitative results. Use RAW_OBSGEN_RESULT to store qualitative results that cannot be harmonized to the defined value set.
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_result_text,NO,,,,NO,,,,Narrative/textual observations. 
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_result_num,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Standardized/converted result for quantitative results. Used to store quantitative results, including the numeric component of numeric results that contain operators (e.g., “<200”, “>= 0.5”). See guidance for RESULT_MODIFIER for further details."

Any symbols in the RAW_RESULT value should be reflected in the RESULT_MODIFIER variable.For example, if the original source data value is ""<=200"" then RAW_RESULT=200 and RESULT_MODIFIER=LE. RESULT_NUM would also be set to “200”. If the original source data value is text, then RESULT_MODIFIER=TX If the original source data value is a numeric value, then RESULT_MODIFIER=EQ"
pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_result_unit,NO,,,,NO,,,,Converted/standardized units for the result.

pcornet,v4,obs_gen,obsgen_id_modified,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Identifier when observation describes attributes of an existing record in the CDM. If observation record modifies something other than the patient (i.e., attribute about an encounter), a link to that record can be included here.
