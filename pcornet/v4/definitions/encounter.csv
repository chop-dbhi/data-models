Details of categorical definitions:  Ambulatory Visit: Includes visits at outpatient clinics, physician offices, same day/ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care facilities, and other same-day ambulatory hospital encounters, but excludes emergency department encounters.    Emergency Department (ED): Includes ED encounters that become inpatient stays (in which case inpatient stays would be a separate encounter). Excludes urgent care visits. ED claims should be pulled before hospitalization claims to ensure that ED with subsequent admission won't be rolled up in the hospital event.   Does not include observation stays, where known (guidance added in v4).    Emergency Department Admit to Inpatient Hospital Stay: Permissible substitution for preferred state of separate ED and IP records. Only for use with data sources where the individual records for ED and IP cannot be distinguished (new to v2.0).    Inpatient Hospital Stay: Includes all inpatient stays, including: same-day hospital discharges, hospital transfers, and acute hospital care where the discharge is after the admission date.  Does not include observation stays, where known (guidance added in v4).    Observation Stay: ‚ÄúHospital outpatient services given to help the can be discharged. Observations services may be given in the emergency department or another area of the hospital.‚Äù Definition from Medicare, CMS Product No. 11435, https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11435.pdf (new value set item added in v4).    Institutional Professional Consult: Permissible substitution when services provided by a medical professional cannot be combined with the given encounter record, such as a specialist consult in an inpatient setting; this situation can be common with claims data sources (new value set item added in v4).    Non-Acute Institutional Stay: Includes hospice, skilled nursing facility (SNF), rehab center, nursing home, residential, overnight non-hospital dialysis and other non-hospital stays.    Other Ambulatory Visit: Includes other non-overnight AV encounters such as hospice visits, home health visits, skilled nursing facility visits, other non-hospital visits, as well as telemedicine, telephone and email consultations. May also include ""lab only"" visits (when a lab is ordered outside of a patient visit), ""pharmacy only"" (e.g., when a patient has a refill ordered without a face-to-face visit), ""imaging only"", etc."
