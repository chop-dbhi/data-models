We include a number of code types for flexibility, but the basic requirement that the code refer to a medical procedure remains.    Revenue codes are a standard concept in Medicare billing and can be useful for defining care settings. If those codes are available they can be included.    Medications administered by clinicians can be captured in billing data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as HCPCS procedure codes. Administration (infusion) of chemotherapy is an example.    We are now seeing NDCs captured as part of procedures because payers are demanding it for payment authorization. Inclusion of this code type enables those data partners that capture the NDC along with the procedure to include the data.   Please note: The “Other” category is meant to identify internal use ontologies and codes. Value set modified in v4 to combine CPT and HCPCS codes into one category; also, ICD-9 value set item typo corrected to ICD-9-PCS."
