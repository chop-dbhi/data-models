The last digit of the LOINC code is a check digit and is always preceded by a hyphen. All parts of the LOINC code, including the hyphen, must be included. Do not pad codes with leading zeros.",

For example, if the original source data value is ""<=200"" then RAW_RESULT=200 and RESULT_MODIFIER=LE. RESULT_NUM would also be set to “200”. If the original source data value is text, then RESULT_MODIFIER=TXIf the original source data value is a numeric value, then RESULT_MODIFIER=EQ "

Values may include a decimal point, a sign or text (e.g., POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, DETECTED). The symbols >, <, >=, <= should be removed from the value and stored in the Modifier variable instead. ",
