We include these categories to allow some flexibility in implementation. The context is to capture available diagnoses recorded during a specific encounter. It is not necessary to populate interim diagnoses unless readily available.  Ambulatory encounters would generally be expected to have a source of ""Final."""

We provide values for ICD and SNOMED code types. Other code types will be added as new terminologies are more widely used.
