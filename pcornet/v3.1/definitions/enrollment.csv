N = No","Chart abstraction flag is intended to answer the question, ""Are you able to request (or review) charts for this person?"" This flag does not address chart availability. Mark as ""Yes"" if there are no contractual or other restrictions between you and the individual (or sponsor) that would prohibit you from requesting any chart for this member.

Note: This field is most relevant for health insurers that can request charts from affiliated providers. This field allows exclusion of patients from studies that require chart review to validate exposures and/or outcomes. It identifies patients for whom charts are never available and for whom the chart can never be requested."

E = Encounter-based","When insurance information is not available but complete capture can be asserted some other way, please identify the basis on which complete capture is defined. Additional information on the approach identified will be required from each partner.

ENR_BASIS is a property of the time period defined. A patient can have multiple entries in the table.

Details of categorical definitions:
Medical insurance coverage: The start and stop dates are based upon enrollment where the health plan has any responsibility for covering medical care for the member during this enrollment period (i.e., if you expect to observe medical care provided to this member during the enrollment period).

Outpatient prescription drug coverage: The start and stop dates are based on enrollment where the health plan has any responsibility for covering outpatient prescription drugs for the member during this enrollment period (i.e., if you expect to observe outpatient pharmacy dispensings for this member during this enrollment period). (New value set item added in v3.1.)

Geography: An assertion of complete data capture between the start and end dates based upon geographic characteristics, such as regional isolation.

Algorithmic: An assertion of complete data capture between the start and end dates, based on a locally developed or applied algorithm, often using multiple criteria.

Encounter-based: The start and stop dates are populated from the earliest-observed encounter and latest-observed encounter.

Field definition and value sets modified in v3.1 to include drug coverage."

For implementation of the CDM, a long span of longitudinal data is desirable; however, especially for historical data more than a decade old, the appropriate beginning date should be determined by the partnerâ€™s knowledge of the validity and usability of the data. More specific guidance can be provided through implementation discussions."
