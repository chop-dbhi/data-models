pcornet,v3.1,condition,onset_date,NO,,,,,,,,The onset date concept here refers to "the date and time when problem (illness, disorder, or symptom) started" (ONC:MU Clinical Data Set, caDSR 4973971). This is a different concept than report date, which is the date on which the medical status was collected. An onset date should generally be considered independently of the observer or provider. However, the judgment of when a condition "started" depends on the disease, the frequency of visits, and many other factors. It is not clear that any facility or physician employs this field in a manner which can be trusted without validation during analysis. (New definition added in v3.1.)
