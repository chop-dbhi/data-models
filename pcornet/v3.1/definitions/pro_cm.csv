pcornet,v3.1,pro_cm,pro_loinc,NO,,,,NO,,,,"LOINC code for item context and stem. the Implementation Guidance for known LOINC codes for each common measure (description updated in v3.1).

Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) from the Regenstrief Institute. Results with local versions of LOINC codes (e.g., LOINC candidate codes) should be included in the RAW_table field, but the PRO_LOINC variable should be set to missing. Current LOINC codes are from 3-7 characters long but Regenstrief suggests a length of 10 for future growth. The last digit of the LOINC code is a check digit and is always preceded by a hyphen. All parts of the LOINC code, including the hyphen, must be included. Do not pad the LOINC code with leading zeros.
