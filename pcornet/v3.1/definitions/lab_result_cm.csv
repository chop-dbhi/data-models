Current LOINC codes are from 3-7 characters long but Regenstrief suggests a length of 10 for future growth. The last digit of the LOINC code is a check digit and is always preceded by a hyphen. All parts of the LOINC code, including the hyphen, must be included. Do not pad the LOINC code with leading zeros.
