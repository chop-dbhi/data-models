Details of categorical definitions:
Ambulatory Visit: Includes visits at outpatient clinics, physician offices, same day/ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care facilities, and other same-day ambulatory hospital encounters, but excludes emergency department encounters.

Emergency Department (ED): Includes ED encounters that become inpatient stays (in which case inpatient stays would be a separate encounter). Excludes urgent care visits. ED claims should be pulled before hospitalization claims to ensure that ED with subsequent admission won't be rolled up in the hospital event.

Emergency Department Admit to Inpatient Hospital Stay: Permissible substitution for preferred state of separate ED and IP records. Only for use with data sources where the individual records for ED and IP cannot be distinguished (new to v2.0).

Inpatient Hospital Stay: Includes all inpatient stays, including: same-day hospital discharges, hospital transfers, and acute hospital care where the discharge is after the admission date.

Non-Acute Institutional Stay: Includes hospice, skilled nursing facility (SNF), rehab center, nursing home, residential, overnight non-hospital dialysis and other non-hospital stays.

Other Ambulatory Visit: Includes other non-overnight AV encounters such as hospice visits, home health visits, skilled nursing facility visits, other non-hospital visits, as well as telemedicine, telephone and email consultations. May also include ""lab only"" visits (when a lab is ordered outside of a patient visit), ""pharmacy only"" (e.g., when a patient has a refill ordered without a face-to-face visit), ""imaging only"", etc."
pcornet,v3,encounter,encounterid,YES,,,,NO,,,,"Arbitrary encounter-level identifier. Used to link across tables, including the ENCOUNTER, DIAGNOSIS, and PROCEDURE tables."
pcornet,v3,encounter,facility_location,NO,,,,NO,,,,Geographic location (3 digit zip code). Should be null if not recorded in source system.
pcornet,v3,encounter,facilityid,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Arbitrary local facility code that identifies the hospital or clinic. Used for chart abstraction and validation.

FACILITYID can be a true identifier, or a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source Data Partner."
pcornet,v3,encounter,patid,YES,DEMOGRAPHIC,PATID,,NO,,,,Arbitrary person-level identifier used to link across tables.
pcornet,v3,encounter,providerid,NO,,,,NO,,,,"Provider code for the provider who is most responsible for this encounter. For encounters with multiple providers choose one so the encounter can be linked to the diagnosis and procedure tables. As with the PATID, the provider code is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the real identifier."
