pedsnet,v2,measurement,measurement_id,Yes,,,A system-generated unique identifier for each measurement
pedsnet,v2,measurement,measurement_source_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,A foreign key to a concept that refers to the code used in the source.
pedsnet,v2,measurement,measurement_source_value,Yes,,,"The measurement name as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference."
pedsnet,v2,measurement,measurement_time,No,,,The time of the measurement.
pedsnet,v2,measurement,measurement_type_concept_id,Yes,concept,concept_id,A foreign key to the predefined concept identifier in the Vocabulary reflecting the type of the measurement.
