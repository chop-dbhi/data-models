pedsnet,v5.3recover,visit_occurrence,person_id,Yes,person,person_id,A foreign key identifier to the person for whom the visit is recorded. The demographic details of that person are stored in the person table.
pedsnet,v5.3recover,visit_occurrence,provider_id,No,provider,provider_id,"A foreign key to the provider in the provider table who was associated with the visit. NOTE: this is NOT in OMOP CDM v4, but appears in OMOP CDMv5. PEDSnet is including the field at this time due to an existing use case (Obesity cohort)."

pedsnet,v5.3recover,visit_occurrence,visit_end_date,Yes,,,"The end date of the visit. If this is a one-day visit the end date should match the start date. If the encounter is on-going at the time of ETL, this should be null."
