pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,concept_class_id,Yes,concept_class,concept_class_id,"The category or class of the concept along both the hierarchical tree as well as different domains within a vocabulary. Examples are “Clinical Drug”, “Ingredient”, “Clinical Finding” etc. "
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,concept_code,Yes,,,"The concept code represents the identifier of the concept in the source data it originates from, such as SNOMED-CT concept IDs, RxNorm RXCUIs etc. Note that concept codes are not unique across vocabularies. "
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,concept_id,Yes,,,A unique identifier for each concept across all domains. 
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,concept_level,Yes,,,"The level of hierarchy associated with the concept. Different concept levels are assigned to concepts to depict their seniority in a clearly defined hierarchy, such as drugs, conditions, etc. A concept level of 0 is assigned to concepts that are not part of a standard vocabulary, but are part of the vocabulary for reference purposes (e.g. drug form). "
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,concept_name,Yes,,,"An unambiguous, meaningful and descriptive name for the concept. "
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,domain_id,Yes,domain,domain_id,The domain a concept belongs to. 
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,invalid_reason,No,,,"Reason the concept was invalidated. Possible values are D (deleted), U (replaced with an update) or NULL when valid_end_date has the default value. "
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,standard_concept,No,,,"This flag determines where a concept is a Standard Concept, i.e. is used in the data, a class concept, or a non-standard concept. The allowables values for standard_concept are: 'S' for Standard Concept, 'C' for a Class Concept, otherwise the content is null for non-standard concepts, including source concepts. Standard Concepts (S) may appear in CDM tables in CONCEPT_ID fields, whereas Class concepts (C) should not appear in the CDM data, but participate in the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR and can be used to identify descendants that may appear in the data. Non-standard concepts can only appear in SOURCE_CONCEPT_ID fields and are not used in CONCEPT_ANCESTOR. "
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,valid_end_date,Yes,,,The date when the concept became invalid because it was deleted or superseded (updated) by a new concept. The default value is 31-Dec-2099. 
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,valid_start_date,Yes,,,The date when the concept was first recorded. 
pedsnet-split,v2.8,concept,vocabulary_id,Yes,vocabulary,vocabulary_id,A foreign key to the vocabulary table indicating from which source the concept has been adapted.
