omop,v5,care_site,Information about the site of care 
omop,v5,concept,"The CONCEPT table contains records that uniquely identify each fundamental unit of meaning used to express clinical information. Concepts are derived from source vocabularies, which represent clinical information across different domains (e.g. conditions, drugs, procedures) through the use of source codes and associated descriptions. Some concepts are designated as standard concepts, meaning these concepts can be used within the OMOP Common Data Model and within standardized analytics. Each standard concept has a primary domain, which defines the location where the concept would be expected to be observed within OMOP Common Data Model. "
omop,v5,concept_ancestor,"The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table contains records that define the inferred hierarchical relationships between all standard concepts. The concept ancestor table is fully derived from the concept, CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP, and relationship tables, whereby all ancestor-descendant relationships can be inferred from traversing all parent-child relationships between standard concepts. The concept ancestor table includes records for all parent-child relationships, as well as grandparent-grandchild relationships and additional levels of lineage. The concept ancestor table enables efficient identification of multi-step hierarchical relationships, such as branded drugs that fall within a therapeutic class or specific diagnosis that are classified within a particular system organ class. "
omop,v5,concept_class,The CONCEPT_CLASS table includes a list of the classifications used to differentiate concepts within a given vocabulary. This reference table is populated with a single record for each concept class and includes a descriptive name for the concept class. 
omop,v5,concept_relationship,"The CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table contains records that define direct relationships between any two concepts and the nature of the relationship. The type of relationship is defined in the Relationship table, and is generally classified as hierarchical (parent-child) or non-hierarchical (lateral). All relationships are directional, and each concept relationship is represented twice symmetrically within the concept relationship table. 'Acute myocardial infarction of the anterior wall'and 'Acute myocardial infarction'have two concept relationships: 1- 'Acute myocardial infarction of the anterior wall""is a""Acute myocardial infarction', and 2- 'Acute myocardial infarction""subsumes""Acute myocardial infarction of the anterior wall'"
omop,v5,concept_synonym,The CONCEPT_SYNONYM table is used to store alternate names and descriptions for a concept. Each synonym is assigned its own unique identifier and contains the text of a description and the identifier of the concept that it represents.
omop,v5,condition_occurrence,A diagnosis or condition that has been recorded about a person at a certain time 
omop,v5,death,Time and cause of death of the Person 
omop,v5,domain,The DOMAIN table includes a list of the domains of data elements that are contained within the OMOP common data model. A domain defines the set of allowable concepts for each standardized field. This reference table is populated with a single record for each domain and includes a descriptive name for the Domain. 
omop,v5,drug_exposure,The drug exposure domain captures any biochemical substance that is introduced in any way to a patient.
omop,v5,drug_strength,The DRUG_STRENGTH table contains structured content about the amount or concentration and associated units of a specific ingredient within a particular drug product. The drug strength table is a supplemental file to support standardized analysis of drug utilization using concepts from the RxNorm vocabulary. A clinical drug concept which contains multiple active ingredients will result in one drug strength record for each active ingredient.
omop,v5,fact_relationship,"The fact relationship domain contains details of the relationships between facts within one domain or across two domains, and the nature of the relationship."
omop,v5,location,"Physical addresses of patients, organizations and care sites "
omop,v5,measurement,The measurement domain captures measurement orders and measurement results. The measurement domain can contain laboratory results and vital signs.
omop,v5,measurement_organism,The measurement organism table contains organism information related to laboratory culture results in the measurement table.
omop,v5,observation,"Observations are clinical facts, such as laboratory tests, signs/symptoms, which are not captured within other CDM tables"
omop,v5,observation_period,"Time intervals during which health care information, such as drugs, conditions, and other clinical observations, may be available "
omop,v5,person,Demographic information about a Person 
omop,v5,procedure_occurrence,Procedures carried out on the Person
omop,v5,provider,Information about health care providers 
omop,v5,relationship,"The RELATIONSHIP table provides a reference list of all allowable types of relationships that can be used to associate any two concepts in the concept relationship table. Relationships are classified as hierarchical (parent-child) or non-hierarchical, and are used to determine which concept relationship records should be included in the computation of the concept ancestor table. "
omop,v5,source_to_concept_map,"The SOURCE_TO_CONCEPT_MAP table is a legacy data structure within the OMOP Common Data Model, recommended for use in extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes to maintain local source codes which are not available as concepts in the Standardized Vocabularies, and to establish mappings for each source code into a standard concept that can be used to populate the Common Data Model tables. The source to concept map table is no longer populated with content within the Standardized Vocabularies published to the OMOP community. "
omop,v5,visit_occurrence,Visits for health care services of the Person
omop,v5,visit_payer,The visit payer table documents insurance information as it relates to a visit in visit_occurrence. For this reason the key of this table will be visit_occurrence_id and visit_payer_id.
omop,v5,vocabulary,The VOCABULARY table includes a list of the vocabularies collected from various sources or created de novo by the OMOP community. This reference table is populated with a single record for each vocabulary source and includes a descriptive name and other associated attributes for the vocabulary.
omop,v5,adt_occurrence,"The adt_occurrence table contains information about distinct admission, discharge, or transfer events that occur as part of a clinical visit."
omop,v5,dose_era,A Dose Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to be exposed to a constant dose of a specific active ingredient.
omop,v5,drug_era,A Drug Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to be exposed to a particular active ingredient.
omop,v5,condition_era,A Condition Era is defined as a span of time when the Person is assumed to have a given condition. 
omop,v5,attribute_definition,The ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION table contains records to define each attribute through an associated description syntax.
omop,v5,cdm_source,The CDM_SOURCE table contains detail about the source database and the  process used to transform the data into the OMOP common data model.
omop,v5,cohort_attribute,"The cohort_attribute table contains attributes assoicated with each subject within a cohort, as defined by a given set of inclusion criteria for a duration of time."
omop,v5,cohort_definition,The cohort definition table contains records to define each derived cohort through an associated description and syntax.
omop,v5,cohort,The COHORT table contains records derived as a set of subjects that satisfy a given set of inclusion criteria for a duration of time.
omop,v5,device_cost,The DEVICE_COST table captures the cost of a medical device or supply used on a Person.
omop,v5,device_exposure,The device exposure domain captures records about a person’s inferred exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument that which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes through a mechanism beyond chemical action.
omop,v5,drug_cost, The Drug Cost table captures records indicating the cost of a Drug Exposure.
omop,v5,note,The NOTE table captures unstructured information that was recorded by a provider or a patient in free text notes on a given date.
omop,v5,payer_plan_period,The PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table captures records that detail the period of time that a person is continuously enrolled under a specific health plan benefit structure from a given payer.
