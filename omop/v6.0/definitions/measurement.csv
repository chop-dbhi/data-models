omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_source_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,,A foreign key to a concept that refers to the code used in the source. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_concept_id,Yes,concept,concept_id,,A foreign key to the standard measurement concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_date,Yes,,,,The date of the Measurement. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_datetime,No,,,,The date and time of the Measurement.
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_time,No,,,,The time of the Measurement. This is present for backwards compatibility and will be deprecated in an upcoming version.
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_id,Yes,,,,A unique identifier for each measurement. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_source_value,No,,,,"The measurement name as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference. "
omop,v6.0,measurement,measurement_type_concept_id,Yes,concept,concept_id,,A foreign key to the predefined concept identifier in the Standardized Vocabularies reflecting the type of data on which the measurement record is based. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,operator_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,,"A foreign key identifier to the mathematical operator that is applied to the value_as_number. Operators are <, ≤, =, ≥, > "
omop,v6.0,measurement,person_id,Yes,person,person_id,,A foreign key identifier to the person about whom the measurement was recorded. The demographic details of that person are stored in the person table. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,provider_id,No,provider,provider_id,,A foreign key to the provider in the provider table who was responsible for making the measurement. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,range_high,No,,,,The upper limit of the normal range of the measurement. The lower range is assumed to be in the same units of measure as the measurement value. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,range_low,No,,,,The lower limit of the normal range of the measurement. The lower range is assumed to be in the same units of measure as the measurement value. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,unit_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,,A foreign key to a standard concept identifier of measurement units in the Standardized Vocabularies. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,unit_source_value,No,,,,"The source code for the unit as it appears in the source data. This code is mapped to a standard unit concept in the Standardized Vocabularies and the original code is, stored here for reference. "
omop,v6.0,measurement,value_as_concept_id,No,concept,concept_id,,"A foreign key to a measurement stored as a concept identifier. This is applicable to measurements where the result can be expressed as a standard concept from the Standardized Vocabularies (e.g., positive/negative, present/absent, low/high, etc.). "
omop,v6.0,measurement,value_as_number,No,,,,A measurement stored as a number. This is applicable to measurement where the result is expressed as a numeric value. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,value_source_value,No,,,,The source value associated with the structured value stored as numeric or concept. This field can be used in instances where the source data are transformed to produce the structured value. 
omop,v6.0,measurement,visit_occurrence_id,No,visit_occurrence,visit_occurrence_id,,A foreign key to the visit in the visit table during which the measurement was recorded.
